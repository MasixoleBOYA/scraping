Explanation of the Query
CurrentMonth CTE:

Retrieves the month-to-date waste (mtd_waste) for each transporter up to the specified date in the current month.
Filters data to the date of interest ('2024-08-03' in this case) to avoid counting future values.
PreviousMonth CTE:

Retrieves month-to-date waste values for each transporter, but for the same day in the previous month.
Filters data up to the same day in the previous month (DATEADD('month', -1, '2024-08-03')).
Main Query:

Joins the two CTEs based on the transporter and day of the month, so it lines up the current and previous month values by transporter and date.
Orders by transporter and date for easy comparison.
This will yield a result with the cumulative month-to-date waste for each transporter, along with the equivalent values for the previous month up to the same day.

Explanation of Changes for MySQL
DATE_FORMAT: MySQL doesnâ€™t have a DATE_TRUNC function like PostgreSQL, so DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m-01') is used to get the first day of the month.

DATE_SUB: MySQL uses DATE_SUB instead of DATEADD to subtract intervals (e.g., INTERVAL 1 MONTH).

Window Functions: MySQL 8.0+ supports window functions, so the cumulative sum with SUM(...) OVER (...) works as in other SQL dialects.

This query will now work with MySQL, providing month-to-date totals for each transporter alongside the same metrics for the same day in the previous month.
